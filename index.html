<p>The Let’s Do Our Best campaign has officially defeated the harmful and cruel ballot measure, Initiated Ordinance 303. After yet another attempt to overpolice and criminalize our unhoused neighbors, Denver voters have shown up and decided that this time, instead of doing “better”, we’re ready to “do our best”. </p>

<p>By <i> decisively </i> defeating this ballot measure, we are sending a message that surveilling and reporting our neighbors is not what the Denver community is about. We’re excited and hopeful to move forward with more equitable and sustainable solutions that truly support people experiencing homelessness, and that are informed by their lived experiences, rather than by dark money and political interests. </p>

<p>We want to thank all of the organizations that supported us in this fight, from educating voters in their community, to posting on social media, from turning out their base to volunteer, to chalking all over the Denver sidewalks. We seriously could not have done this without you and every day we are so grateful for the community that we’ve built. We’re ready to continue to fight harder for our unhoused neighbors, at a time when they need our support more than ever. We hope that you’ll continue to support us in that fight. Thank you.</p>
